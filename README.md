This code receives a .bmp picture and applyes a filter to it using the functions in the "helpers.c". 
This code was made during the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and is partially composed by code composed by the teachers.
The filters present in the code are represented by the following letters:

'b' - Blur = blurs the image by turning a pixel into the average values of it and the surrounding original pixels.
'e' - Edges = Uses a function using surrounding pixels to evaluete the edges of the objects in the image.
'r' - Reflect = Mirrors the picture horizontaly.
'g' - Gray Scale = Turns the three RGB values in a given pixel into the avarage of their sum.
